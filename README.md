Welcome to Circus, previously Golux

Circus is a big one, and is currently in development. The end goal with Circus is to let users create complex form systems, completely from no code.

There are several components to Golux, key ones being:

Circus Core: A place where users can create applications for data collection, completely in no code. Users can have AI autofill their demands or manually make edits, or both. 

*Say you own a car dealership, and you need a platform that lets your employees track inventory, track customers, link customers with vehicles... a lot of stuff*

*Just create your system and deploy it with Circus! Have complete control of who accesses your system and you dont need to pay a development team any dime! everything is built from the ground up, you wire your own system.*

Circus Head: A Circus head is a working client that renders completely from the server. Circus heads are convenient for horizontal scalling, and are completely decoupled from the CMS.

Circus is heavily inspired by legacy systems. Circus uses a dotnet server for its CMS and each head. Golux also uses SignalR as a main communication method from server to heads. Circus uses a collection of React components, with heavy inspiration from Sencha ExtJS.
